Generating the Basho/CentOS-6.7 Box
---

Start with the [Bento/CentOS-6.7](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/bento/boxes/centos-6.7) Box.

#### Generally useful packages

    sudo yum --nogpgcheck -y install vim emacs git perl


#### Demo app

We're using Ruby for the demo application, so we need to navigate some dependency... "fun".

We'll be using `rvm` to install Ruby 1.9.3, which comes with Gem and Bundler, which will let us install a number of Ruby dependencies required for the demo.

    sudo yum --nogpgcheck -y groupinstall development
    gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
    curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    source ~/.profile
    rvm install 1.9.3

    git clone https://github.com/drewkerrigan/riak-inverted-index-demo
    cd riak-inverted-index-demo
    bundle install

With Ruby and the correct Gem set installed, want want to expose those binaries to the root user in case we need to run an application in elevated privileges. Which is a pretty hacky thing to do, admittedly. And we're going to get it done with an equally hacky trick.

Please never do this on a real-world system.

    echo '' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo '[[ -s "/home/vagrant/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/home/vagrant/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*' >> ~/.bash_profile

    echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/home/vagrant/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting' >> ~/.bashrc


#### Zabbix Client

We're going to be using Zabbix, and its MySQL backend, for our monitoring solution. Luckily, for us, they have a yum repo already set up.

    sudo rpm -ivh http://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/2.4/rhel/6/x86_64/zabbix-release-2.4-1.el6.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum --nogpgcheck -y install zabbix-agent zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-web-mysql mysql mysql-server
