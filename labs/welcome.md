Welcome
----
To get the day started, you will need to have downloaded the Vagrantbox used for the labs.  If you do not have it, please flag down one of the instructors.  Since conference room WiFi is always questionable, they will have the course assets on a limited number of flash drives.

Lab 0: Start up the lab environment
---

Locate the folder into which you copied the Vagrant environment.  For the purpose of these instructions, we will assume that the environment is in a folder named *Operations_Lab* in your home directory and that your home directory can be accessed via the *~* alias.
 

At a shell prompt, Return the following commands:

**<span style="font-family:monospace">cd ~/Operations_Lab</span>**  
**<span style="font-family:monospace">ls -al</span>**

You should have a directory listing similar to the following:

```
README.md   Vagrantfile bin         data
```

#### The lab environment
The lab environment consists of a Vagrantfile that will build 6 CentOS 6.5 nodes.  Five to be used as Riak nodes and one to be used in the load balancer and monitoring exercises.

| nodename | IP address     |
| -------: | -------------- |
| app      | 192.168.228.10 |
| node1    | 192.168.228.11 |
| node2    | 192.168.228.12 |
| node3    | 192.168.228.13 |
| node4    | 192.168.228.14 |
| node5    | 192.168.228.15 |

To bring up the environment, type **<span style="font-family:monospace">vagrant up</span>**. Vagrant will download the box file if necessary, start the virtual machines, and provision the software on the nodes.
